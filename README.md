# Learn about me
I have studied Application Development at Middle School of Electrical Engineering and since then developed software systems even in my free time.

My experience lies mostly in web platforms with tools like `React & Next.js`. In fact, I have 2+ years of experience with these two.
This should tell you that I'm well-versed in `Javascript and Typescript` on the frontend side.

- web-app for ai-based physics simulations [platform.siml.ai](https://platform.siml.ai)
- headless CMS for blog on [dimensionlab.org/blog](https://dimensionlab.org/blog)

Regarding backend, I have developed several server solutions using `Python` and lots of `Node` servers.

I code as a hobby and in my free time I study and develop `cryptographic` solutions around `bitcoin`, `ethereum` and `encryption` systems.

I have also base experience in `Rust` and in the past few months I've come to love `golang`.
